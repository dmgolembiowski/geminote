**What Geminote Does:**

Geminote gently (and securely!) lifts Chrome's restrictions on accessing local files via the `file:///` protocol.  This means you can:

### View Markdown files
> Quickly preview your notes, documentation, or blog posts.

### Access local data files
>  View source code, logs, config files, or any plaintext!

### Save your sanity
> You won't be redownloading these files anymore! ðŸ˜Œ
